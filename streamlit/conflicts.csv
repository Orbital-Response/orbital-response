Israel-Palestine Conflict,31.7683,35.2137,"Hamas launched its deadly attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, prompting the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to engage in aerial campaigns and ground operations within the Gaza Strip. In January 2025, the United States, Egypt, and Qatar announced that they had mediated a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas to end fifteen months of war. However, Israel renewed its offensive in March 2025, launching a major military campaign across the territory, including Gaza City, Khan Yunis, and Rafah. Israel’s two-month total blockade of humanitarian aid has caused famine-like conditions and a deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The United Nations criticized Israel’s new aid system, which is restricted to a few distribution sites and forces Palestinians to travel long distances to secure aid, as violating humanitarian principles.
